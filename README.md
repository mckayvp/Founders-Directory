# Founders-Directory

A profile-based list of Founders that can be viewed like contacts with dummy data.

### Done Well
Perhaps due to the minimal requirements of this project, I feel like I was able to organize the controllers so they are easy to see how they interact with the views.
I thought it better to not include what would be my profile in the list and instead have a link to my own profile to view and edit. This felt like it would make more sense to a user to have this separation from their profile and other profiles.
Most the code is made of small functions and ordered in a way that makes sense along with enough comments to remind me what each section is doing.

### Not Done So Well
I had too many issues getting started with the split-view controller and I think the app would be much better if I had got that to work.
Due to the issues I was having getting started I decided to not use any models and instead hard-coded all my data so it was reduced to minimal requirements.
I'm still trying to understand the best practices of how to code and connect to the main story board. A lot of how stuff works together is still a bit of a black box to me, but I hope with continued practice and experimenting it will start to come together more.
The code overall could likely be more concise and efficient.
